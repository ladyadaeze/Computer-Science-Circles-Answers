                                CODING EXERCISE: Last Character


1. Question: What expression can be used to determine the last character in a string S?

Answer: 
s[len(S)-1]

2. Question: Write a program which reads a string using input(), and outputs the same string 
but with the first and last character deleted. (You may assume the input string has length at
least 2.) For example, on input Fairy a correct program will print air.

Answer: 
ada = (input())
        print(ada[1:len(ada)-1])

3. Question: Write a program which reads a string using input(),
and outputs the same string but with the first and last
character exchanged. (You may assume the input string has 
length at least 2.) For example, on input Fairy a correct 
program will print yairF. Hint: use your solution to the 
previous program as part of the answer.

Answer: 
ada = (input())
print(ada[-1] + ada[1:-1] + ada[:1])

4. Question: Write a program that takes a character as input (a string of length 1),
which you should assume is an upper-case character; the output should be the next 
character in the alphabet. If the input is 'Z', your output should be 'A'. 
(You will need to use an if statement.

Answer: 
input = (input()).upper()
encrypted = ""
for character in input:
    if character == "":
        encrypted += ""
    elif ord(character) + 1 > ord("Z"):
        encrypted += chr(ord(character) + 1 - 26)
    else:
        encrypted += chr(ord(character) + 1)

print(encrypted)



                                CODING EXERCISE: Pig Latin
                                
                                
5. Question: Pig Latin is a nonsense language. To transform a word from English to Pig Latin, 
you move the first letter to the end and add "ay" after that. For example, monkey becomes onkeymay
in Pig Latin, and word becomes ordway. Write a program that takes a single word as input and 
translates it to Pig Latin. (In reality, Pig Latin has rules that are more complex than this, 
but we ignore them for the purposes of this exercise.)

Answer:
def main():
    lst = ['sh', 'gl', 'ch', 'ph', 'tr', 'br', 'fr', 'bl', 'gr', 'st', 'sl', 'cl', 'pl', 'fl']
    sentence = input()
    sentence = sentence.split()
    for k in range(len(sentence)):
        i = sentence[k]
        if i[0] in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']:
            sentence[k] = i + 'ay'
        elif t(i) in lst:
            sentence[k] = i[2:] + i[:2] + 'ay'
        elif i.isalpha() == False:
            sentence[k] = i
        else:
            sentence[k] = i[1:] + i[0] + 'ay'
    return ' '.join(sentence)


def t(str):
    return str[0] + str[1]


if __name__ == "__main__":
    x = main()
    print(x)
