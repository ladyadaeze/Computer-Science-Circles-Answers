Egg cartons each hold exactly 12 eggs. Write a program which reads an integer number of eggs from input(),
then prints out two numbers: how many cartons can be filled by these eggs, and
how many eggs will be left over. 


Answer:
eggs = (int(input()))
print(eggs // 12) #Performs a division, showing the result and ignoring the  remainder, giving you the exact number of cartons that can be filled by the "eggs" variable
print(eggs % 12)  #Performs a second division, this time showing only the remainder, giving you the exact number of eggs that will be left over



                                Coding Exercise: Divisibility
Write a program that reads two positive integers a and b on separate lines. 
If a is divisible by b, print the message "divisible". Otherwise, 
print the message "not divisible".


Answer:
number_one = (int(input()))
number_two = (int(input()))

if number_one % number_two == 0:
   print("divisible")
else:
   print("not divisible")
   
   
   
                                  Coding Exercise: Pizza Circles
Your friends have eaten their square pizzas and are now ordering a round pizza.
Write a program to calculate the area of this circular pizza. 
The input is a float r, which represents the radius in cm. 
The output should be the area in cm2, calculated using the formula  
A=pi*r2. Use Python's pi feature instead of typing 3.1415...



Answer:

import math
r = float(input())
area = math.pi * r * r
print(area)
